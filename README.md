# YouthCodePythonCodingCamp
This repo includes all the material I used to teach a week-long Intro to Python Code Camp in 2017. I taught this camp through [YouthCode](https://www.facebook.com/YouthCodeDSM/), a non-profit in Des Moines.

This material was presented to 3rd - 8th grade students. These students had previous experience with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), so they were pretty familiar with some of the basics like if statements and loops already.
